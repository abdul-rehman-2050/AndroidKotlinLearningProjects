## DATABASE SQLite Is used

In this project we used helper class 

compile 'com.readystatesoftware.sqliteasset:sqliteassethelper:+' 

This helper help us in reading database from Assets/databases folder

I created a simplest lisview with lambda item click listner to populate all titles from database and when one item is clicked the 
description activity is opened which takes two parameters from intent. one is title and 2nd is body
